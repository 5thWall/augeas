0.0.4 - 2008-02-25
  - package as RPM and make sure Augeas can be build on Fedora/RHEL

0.0.3 - 2008-02-25
  - further rework; file processing now resembles Boomerang lenses much
    more closely
  - major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
    multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
  - move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
    enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)

0.0.2 - 2008-01-29:
  - completely reworked
  - processing of files is now based on a textual description of the
    structure of the files (basically a LL(1) grammar)

0.0.1 - 2007-12-01:
  - First release. 
  - Public API and basic tree data structure. 
  - Record scanning works. 
  - Providers for pam.d, inittab and /etc/hosts
  - Simple tests and test driver
