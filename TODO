- better error message for "short split in concat"

- this needs to make aug_save fail:

  set /files/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bar/type deb
  set /files/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bar/uri http://server.com/
  set /files/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bar/distribution etch
  save

  The paths are missing a 1/ after the bar/ and do not conform to the schema

- completion of paths with spaces in augtool needs to be smarter about quoting
  spaces

- permutation operator: often, options for commands can be permuted in any
  order. Using '*' for that is a bit of a kludge since it allows giving the
  same option many times.

- sshd.aug is wrong: it does not express that Match must come at the end of
  the file and that anything after a match only applies to that
  block. That's specifically a problem if a new entry is added to the tree;
  that will show up in a Match block, when it should show up _before_ the
  first Match block

- Better POSIX compliance for fa_compile: in particular, support named
  character classes and allow /|a/ to mean 'epsilon or a'

- Sprinkle the words 'get' and 'put' into error messages from the lens
  typechecks to make it clearer which direction (and regexps) they are
  talking about
