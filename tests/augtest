# Read a file with a test description, run augtool against it and
# look at the diff between the original file and the .augnew file
# The test description can contain the following:
# commands - a string that is fed to augtool
# diff     - a hash mapping file names to the diff between that
#            file and the .augnew file
# echo     - boolean, when true show the whole ouput of augtool
# refresh  - boolean, when true print bad diffs in a form
#            that can be easily cut&pasted back into the test description
